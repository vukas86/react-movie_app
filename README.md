## Overview

Through building I'MDD, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in component-based architecture, state management, and data fetching. This project allowed me to sharpen my React abilities while creating a user-friendly and visually appealing application. I'm excited to share I'MDD as a showcase of my growth and dedication as a React developer.
